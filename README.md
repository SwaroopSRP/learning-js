# learning-js
Continuing on my Web Dev journey, the 3rd pillar of it is to learn &amp; master JS. All code files available here.

For basic learning, I am using Deno as my JavaScript runtime for simplicity and minimalism. However, I would be switching to Node.js for learning back-end. That'll go in separate repos.
